- **`attachment_endpoints.py`** - Updated to use unified storage system
- **`requirements.txt`** - Added boto3 and botocore for AWS SDK

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Storage Backend (local or s3)
STORAGE_BACKEND=local|s3

# S3 Configuration (when using S3)
S3_BUCKET=psc-accounting
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Testing (Local Storage)
```bash
# Set environment
export STORAGE_BACKEND=local

# Start server
cd backend
python main.py
```

### For Production (S3 Storage)
```bash
# Run setup script
cd backend
./setup_s3_migration.sh

# Or manual setup:
export STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
export S3_BUCKET=psc-accounting
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret

# Run database migration
psql -d psc_accounting -f migration_s3_support.sql

# Start server
python main.py
```

## 📊 Storage Management API

### New Endpoints Available

```bash
# Get storage configuration and stats
GET /storage/info

# Test S3 connection
GET /storage/test-s3

# Migrate local files to S3
POST /storage/migrate-to-s3?dry_run=true|false

# Clean up orphaned files
POST /storage/cleanup?storage_backend=local|s3

# Get usage by company
GET /storage/usage-by-company
```

## 🏗️ File Organization

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Company Isolation** - Files organized by company ID
- **Server-side Encryption** - S3 files encrypted with AES256
- **Access Control** - Secure presigned URLs for file access
- **Permission Validation** - IAM permissions checked on startup
- **File Type Validation** - Dangerous file types blocked

## 🔄 Migration Process

### Automatic Migration
The system can migrate existing local files to S3:

1. **Dry Run** - Preview migration without moving files
2. **Selective Migration** - Migrate specific companies
3. **Batch Processing** - Handle large migrations efficiently
4. **Error Handling** - Detailed error reporting and rollback

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Preview migration
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/storage/migrate-to-s3?dry_run=true"

# Migrate all files
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/storage/migrate-to-s3"

# Migrate specific company
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/storage/migrate-to-s3?company_id=1"
```

## 📈 Benefits Achieved

### For Development
- **Local Testing** - No AWS costs during development
- **Fast Iteration** - Quick file operations without network calls
- **Offline Development** - Work without internet connection

### For Production
- **Scalability** - Unlimited storage capacity with S3
- **Reliability** - 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
- **Cost Efficiency** - Pay only for storage used
- **Global Access** - CDN integration possibilities
- **Compliance** - Enterprise-grade security and compliance

### For All Transactions
The implementation supports attachments for:
- ✅ **Invoices** - Receipts, purchase orders, contracts
- ✅ **Expenses** - Receipts, bills, supporting documents
- ✅ **Payroll** - Payslips, timesheets, contracts
- ✅ **Bank Statements** - Statement files, transaction records

## 🎛️ Operational Features

### Monitoring & Health Checks
- S3 connection testing
- Storage usage statistics
- File integrity verification
- Performance metrics

### Maintenance Tools
- Orphaned file cleanup
- Storage optimization
- Migration rollback capabilities
- Batch operations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
- Added `storage_backend` column (local/s3)
- Added `s3_bucket` and `s3_key` columns
- Added indexing for efficient queries
- Added `updated_at` timestamp tracking

### API Compatibility
- All existing endpoints work unchanged
- New storage management endpoints added
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Legacy endpoints preserved

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Switching Storage Backends
- Change `STORAGE_BACKEND` environment variable
- Restart the application
- Files remain accessible from previous backend
- Use migration tools to move files between backends

### Cost Considerations
- S3 Standard: $0.023/GB/month
- S3 requests: $0.0004/1000 PUT, $0.0004/1000 GET
- Data transfer: First 1GB free per month
- Consider lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### Security Best Practices
1. Use IAM roles in production (not access keys)
2. Enable S3 bucket encryption
3. Set up proper bucket policies
4. Enable access logging for auditing
5. Use VPC endpoints for private access

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **S3 Connection Failed** - Check AWS credentials and permissions
2. **Migration Errors** - Verify file permissions and S3 access
3. **File Not Found** - Check storage backend configuration
4. **Large File Uploads** - Verify S3 multipart upload limits

### Diagnostic Tools
```bash
# Test S3 connection
curl http://localhost:8000/storage/test-s3

# Check configuration
curl http://localhost:8000/storage/info

# View storage statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/attachments/stats
```

## ✅ Ready for Production

Your PSC Accounting app is now ready for production deployment with enterprise-grade file storage capabilities. The system automatically handles:

- File uploads to S3 or local storage
- Secure file downloads with proper authentication
- Multi-company file isolation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Storage usage monitoring and optimization

Switch between local and S3 storage anytime by changing the `STORAGE_BACKEND` environment variable!
